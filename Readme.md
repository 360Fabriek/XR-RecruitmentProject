## Details
- You are creating a standalone VR Pool Game.
- Hand tracking is not mandatory but a huge bonus.
- Use OpenXR with bindings for Oculus.
- Max development time: **6 hours**!
- Focus on getting the core ready before working on other features.
- Ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code to highlight your coding skills.
- Create a fork on github and open a pull request so we can easily look through the code.

## Core Mechanics:
- **Cue Handling**: Grab and aim the cue using XR controllers or hand gestures.
- **Ball Striking**: Apply force to the cue to hit the balls.
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic ball movements and collisions.
## Minimalistic Game Loop:
- Start game → Strike balls into the pockets → Show amount of balls in pocket and on table → Reset table when either stripes or solids are all in the pocket.
## UI/Feedback:
- Simple score display using world-space canvases.

## **If you have time over, be creative!**
