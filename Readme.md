## Core Mechanics:
- **Cue Handling**: Grab and aim the cue using XR controllers or hand gestures.
- **Ball Striking**: Apply force to the cue to hit the balls.
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic ball movements and collisions.
## Minimalistic Game Loop:
- Start game → Strike balls into the pockets → Show amount of balls in pocket and on table → Reset table when either stripes or solids are all in the pocket.
## UI/Feedback:
- Simple score display using world-space canvases.
